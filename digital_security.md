## Theft

On a business trip to a foreign country a coworker left their cellphone in taxi after coming back from a meeting. The ride was hailed and paid through another coworkers ridesharing app. They called the driver to come back. Driver returned in a few minutes. Car was searched and no phone was found. Driver claimed there was no phone and it must have fallen out before he got in the taxi.  Coworker went back to hotel and found the last GPS on the phone was at the hotel and it was turned off. Google's [Android Find My Device](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6160491?hl=en) was not enabled. Those of us riding in the car, know the phone was there and was stolen. Difficulty was a majority of the contacts and WhatsApp connects were on the phone and not stored in a secondary location. His banking information was only logged into the phone and not laptop. This business trip had 2 more weeks and needed a phone for work and to pay bills back home. They purchased a phone locally and got a temporary number in that country. This allowed contact with the team and customers. Difficutly was could not pay bills or join back to all WhatsApp groups because the phone had a new phone number. They called their cell phone provider and was not able to get an issue of the phone number again. This was in 2016 before eSIM available in phones; [iPhone XS and Pixel 2 in 2017 had this capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESIM).

## Phone Number Switch

Switching from one cell provider to another often has great incenties for rebates or phone discounts when switching. This is common in the USA with the 3 big telecom companies, AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon.  Individual switched carries and didn't fill out proper paperwork or release the number from the prior to the new cell service provider. Once the new phone was setup and old account closed lost the prior phone number. They had two-factor authentication (2FA) mandatory on their Google account. This was the only 2FA method. The Google account is now locked out with no possibility of access.

> Most countries since 2010 have [local number portability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_number_portability) The United States started in 1997 with the [Telecommunication Act of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996). Prior to number portability each telecommuincatio provider had a set block of numbers and could not interchange phone numbers. This meant at the switching from Sprint to AT&T or US-Cellular to T-Mobile a new phone number issued at time of service.
