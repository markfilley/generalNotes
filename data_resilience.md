# Data Resilience

Digital life is fully upon us. Smart phones are the primary way photos are taken. Email, texts and documents in personal and work life. Less and less are the documents printed or handwritten. If it is printed, it came from a digital source. Of the digital files, the photos are often the most treasured. Other documents such as your high school and college essages, software code, contracts, customer invoices and many more documents are equally valued.

### Local

### RAID is not a backup
